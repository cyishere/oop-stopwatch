This is the practice of [Object-oriented Programming in JavaScript: Made Super Simple | Mosh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFmuCDHHpwk) on Youtube which tutorial I learned to get a better understanding of OOP in JavaScript.

`script.js` is my solution, `mosh_solution.js` is Mosh's.

Cons in mine: I didn't use the getter to protect the property `duration`, this may cause some problems.
